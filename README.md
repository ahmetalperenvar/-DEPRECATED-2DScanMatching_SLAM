# Scan Matching 2D Toolbox - DEPRECATED

The Scan Matching 2D Toolbox is a collection of 2D ScanMatching functions for range finder sensors.
It contains a set of 12 algorithms plus a simple random world generator.
It lets the user test algorithms with different parameters and different world and it is important to
understand how ScanMatching and SLAM works. The user will be able to work and modify an open
source MATLAB code for its own purposes. This document explains how the toolbox can be executed
and defines the internal structure so that the user can modify the code.

##### Notes: This investigation was performed in 2011 and it has not been kept up to date. Most of past years investigation relies on 3D scan matching thus this algorithms are still somewhat actual. The purpose of the package is purely educational. The code is not optimized nor efficient.

# Simple Execution

To execute the file, simply include the root directory in your MATLAB path, then, type (or run)

```
slam
```

At this point a random map will be generated
and displayed on the screen and the user will
have to draw the robot trajectory with the
mouse then press Enter to start the
computation. The default parameters will
generate a random structured world and will
correct the trajectory using an EKF based
SLAM and ICP.

# Scan Matchers configuration
The following are the sensitive parameters for each aglorithm. The table shows the default and recommended parameters which are valid for most use cases. Playing with these parameters could deliver better or worse results.

# Other Configurations

In order to change the following parameters. Modify the file Etc/cfg.m

#### input_traj = 1 
Specify whether the user is going to
select the robot trajectory o r using a
default one.

#### world = wall_generator(0.1,1)
The world generation changing the object
wall_generator.
The first parameter controls how many ellipses
will define the world. More ellipses will generate
a less shaped world. If the first parameter is 0,
then, the world will be unstructured, ie. It will
simulates outdoor natural enviroments (caves,
rocks).
The second parametrs control whether the user has
to insert the trajectory. Do not change, use the
previous variable to work modify this.

#### DEBUG
This struct contains an entry for each algorithm
and control whether to plot the algorithm as it is
functioning.

#### Opt.map 
Controls the mapping function for the algorithms.
Used by some of them (please refer to the paper).
The parameter Opt.map.resolution controls the
resolution of the working space for some of the
algorithm and must be changed according to the
optimal parameters (listed below). Vary this
parameter to test how the algorithms behave.

#### Opt.plot 
Controls the plotting. Leave unchanged except

#### Opt.plot.robot_scale
increase if the robot figure is not visible or too big.

#### Opt.filter 
Opt.filter.usefilter says whether to use a stochastic
filter or not. Opt.filter.type tells which filter. (only
ekf 2 d availabe).

#### Opt.scanmatcher 
Controls most of the scanmatching parameters.

#### usematcher 
Do scan matching?

#### motionamount 
Travel X distance before doing another
scanmatching (m)

#### handle
Tells which algorithm to use for scan matching.
Upon changing this, remember to change the parameters as in the scan matcher optionsl list below.

#### associate 
Specify which association method to use. Only if 'handle' is set to 'icpbSM'.

#### register 
Specify which registration method to use. Only if 'handle' is set to 'icpbSM'.

#### rejection 
Only value @x84. Uses x84 rjection rule during
association. Only for ICP based methods

#### projfilter
Use projection filter to remove points not visible.
Available for all

#### convalue
Convergence accuracy. The higher is this value
the slower will take to converge. (might never
converge if too high, but will stop when the max
number is reached)

####  Opt.scan 
Controls the scan forming. The only availabel
options tells the maximum number of points
before completing a full scan. Generally leave
unchanged

####  Opt.error 
Tells whether to display the SLAM result
